# playlist-generator
Create m3u playlist, with relative path for a tutorial like directory (containing multiple folders with video/audio files)

Simply place the `make_playlist.py` file into the root directory containing the videos or provide the full path to the root directory while running the file.

To run the file, type the following command in the terminal:

`python make_playlist.py` or `python make_playlist.py <<full_path_to_the_root_directory>>`

The script will create `.m3u` playlist in each subfolder containing video/audio files.

So if you have a video tutorial series, just run the script and you will get all the playlist generated for you!
